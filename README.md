# E-commerce

I developed an engaging and user-friendly e-commerce mobile application using Flutter for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end. The app provides an intuitive shopping experience with a clean, modern UI design optimized for mobile devices.

Key features include:

- Secure user authentication powered by Firebase Authentication allowing customers to easily sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.

- Integration with the Firebase Cloud Firestore database enabling real-time data syncing across users & easy content management.

- Implementation of the Razorpay API for quick, reliable and secure checkouts and payments processing.

- Modular code architecture following the MVC pattern to ensure scalability and maintainability.

- Attractive product listings with filtering, search, and smooth image carousels for an immersive browsing experience.

- Intuitive cart and order management system for seamless checkout.

- Push notifications to update users on order status and other updates.

The app provides a complete mobile e-commerce solution combining Flutter's excellent cross-platform capabilities with Firebase's flexible and scalable BaaS. The integration of Razorpay allows for a smooth payment experience. The use of MVC architecture and modular code ensures the app can scale as more features are added. Overall, it delivers an engaging shopping experience conveniently accessible from mobile device
